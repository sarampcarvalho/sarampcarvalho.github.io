I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.ua.pt/en/p/10320064) at the Águeda School of Technology and Management - University of Aveiro, where I have been teaching since 2002, namely in the fields of Languages for Specific Purposes (English and German) and translation technologies. Since the 1st semester of the 2022/23 academic year, I have been co-lecturing the curricular unit of Technical Communication from the joint PhD Program in Translation and Terminology (Aveiro University/NOVA University Lisbon). I have also been responsible for the curricular unit of German Linguistics at the Department of Languages and Cultures of the University of Aveiro since 2013.

I hold a PhD in Linguistics, with a specialisation in Lexicology, Lexicography and Terminology, from the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities – Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (NOVA FCSH). My thesis, entitled “[A terminological approach to knowledge organization within the scope of endometriosis: the EndoTerm project](http://hdl.handle.net/10362/49745)”, was developed within the scope of a co-tutelle agreement between the Universidade NOVA de Lisboa and the Communauté Université Grenoble Alpes.

I also hold an MA in German Studies – specialisation in German Linguistics – from the University of Aveiro (UA), and graduated in Modern Languages and Literature (English and German Studies) at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities – University of Coimbra. In my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to spend a year studying at Universität Leipzig.

I am currently a researcher (integrated member) from the [LLT (Lexicology, Lexicography and Terminology) team](https://clunl.fcsh.unl.pt/en/groups_clunl/lexicologia-lexicografia-terminologia/team/) at the Linguistics Research Centre of NOVA University Lisbon (NOVA CLUNL) and a collaborator from the [Translation and Terminology project](https://www.ua.pt/en/cllc/page/23270) at the Languages, Literatures and Cultures Research Centre of the University of Aveiro (CLLC-UA).

In addition, I am a member of the ISO/TC 37 and of the Portuguese mirror committee "CT 221 – Terminologia, Língua e Linguagens" at the Portuguese Institute for Quality (IPQ). I also integrate the [COST Action 18209 - European network for Web-centred linguistic data science](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA18209/), where I lead Working Group 4 (Use cases and applications).
